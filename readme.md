# Mermaid for .net
The need was to see each method dependencies (what methods uses). The existing solutions do not provide such functionality. Yeah, talking about : 
* [Zen.ndepend](https://www.ndepend.com/docs/class-dependency-diagram)
* [Fatesoft.Program Flow chart Generator](https://www.fatesoft.com/)

Without [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) could not be possible!  

This project uses : 
* [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) - to read assembly entities
* [mermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) - to display the flowchart

reference : 
* <https://github.com/itn3000/Cs2Mermaid> - .NET `syntax tree` to mermaid diagram
* <https://github.com/samsmithnz/MermaidDotNet> - .NET wrapper to create Mermaid
* <https://github.com/jespervandijk/mermaid-class-diagram-generator> - UML

> [!TIP]  
> draw.io - can import mermaid - use "Arrange" > "Insert" > "Advanced" > "Mermaid"
